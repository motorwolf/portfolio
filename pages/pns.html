<h2>Pinkies Nail Salons</h2>
    <p class="about">When I first encountered the website, it had table layout and several flash elements that badly needed updating. I took much of the content and, starting from the ground up, developed a new webpage with a fully integrated blog that could handle most every inquiry customers had, on whatever device they were using.</p>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <h3>Design Concept</h3>
           <p>Pinkies Nail Salons was a chain of nail salons with a cozy shabby-chic aesthetic. I developed a color palette for the website that echoed the muted tones of the salon, using cream, off-white, rich magenta, and a dark teal that played well off the cream. The headline fonts encorporated a fanciful script, which echoed the signature in the logotype yet maintained readability for the web.</p>
            <figure class="full">
                <img class="pageimg" class="pageimg" src="../img/pages/pns/pns1.png" alt="" title="Desktop version of the site.">
                <figcaption>Desktop version of the site.</figcaption>
            </figure>
 
           <p>The old website used a very heavy but beautifully rendered hand-drawn toile. Since this was part of the Pinkies' signature aesthetic, the owners wanted to continue to use it. I created a lighter version of the artwork that was a nod to the original, without being too heavy visually and detracting from the usability of the website.</p>
            <p>We noticed that many users were opening our email campaigns from phones, so I made it a priority to provide a streamlined experience for mobile users, with finger-friendly size buttons that enabled them to call any salon with ease. </p>

        </figure>
        <h3>Homepage Promotions </h3>
        <p>We wanted to provide a reason to return to the site, and the homepage promotion was just the thing. Since it was not always practical to change these homepages the moment they were launched, I coded a solution through our Wordpress that enabled us to set a timer on the homepage promotion. The image, text, and stipulation text would be automatically changed on the date specified. This enabled us to plan promotions in advance and enabled other
employees to set up promotions through the backend well in advance without coding.

            <h3>Website Functionality</h3>
            <p>Our demographic was an older, mature woman who did not mind paying a bit more for a luxurious, spa-like experience in a boutique nail salon. They tended to have the latest model tablets and phones, but were not particularly tech-savvy. Most visitors to the site were looking to dial directly to their favorite salon or find pricing information, which we prioritized.</p>
            <p>Cultivating our email list was extremely lucrative for us, because we found that on days promotions were launched, the call rate would double and triple, not just for the promotion in question. Our open rate was very high and users enjoyed the variety of content. Mailing lists are unusual for nail salons, and so many users were unaware that we offered this content. Therefore it was important to make it as noticable as possible on the website. There was a sign-up form on
                the old site, but it used a very inefficient method of sending the info via a PHP script to a customer service email address, which was then manually added to a database, sometimes days later. This was not only inefficient but error prone, and insecure. I used the Mailchimp API to allow the user to sign-up directly to the list, eliminating all friction and allowing for immediate feedback. Thanks to the ease of the form, we began seeing many more sign-ups, higher
            open rates, and more engagement.</p>

        <h3>SEO Optimization</h3>
        <p>While coding the site, I made sure that our content was easily digestible by Google and used schema markup. Our organic traffic increased by leaps and bounds after the redesign. By monitoring with Webmaster Tools and Google Analytics, I was able to pinpoint drop-off points and streamline the process for the user.</p>

        <h3>Wordpress Blog</h3>

            <figcaption>The mobile view of the blog. The bottom arrows would cycle though the previous five posts.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Our users mostly came to the site to call or find a location, but I wanted to invite them to stay and be engaged by articles and featurettes that were targeted right to them. Our beauty pieces on nail trends were incredibly popular and led to many in-store requests. I used wordpress as a backend so that many other employees could write and add content. I coded this front-end so that a revolving carousel of five blogs could be cycled through on the homepage. The blogs were great and attracted much attention, but I didn't want to annoy the more casual, information driven user, and so I implemented the folding carousel as a way of showcasing the content without it being too overwhelming.
