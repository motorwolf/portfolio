<h2>InPink Fashion Jewelry</h2>
<p class="about">InPink was a fashion jewelry brand ecommerce site launched on the Magento platform. I developed several themes for the content, blog entries, product pages, landing pages optimized for conversion, and forms that delivered coupon codes integrated with mailchimp API for sign-ups.</p>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <h3>Page Design</h3>
    <p>One of our main methods of promotion on the site was partnerships with bloggers and sponsored events. We wanted to provide a personalized experience for these users to welcome them to the site, feature specific products their users would be interested in, and offer them specific coupon discounts.</p>

        <p>Our email campaigns and promotions were the most important element of the site, offering unique styled content for the user. When buying fashion jewelry, the options are overwhelming. Our email campaigns featured curated content to take the guesswork out of accessorizing.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<h3>Site Evolution</h3>
<p>As the site grew, our third-party platforms became a more lucrative avenue than the site itself. We made a decision to use our website as a "showroom" to complement these 3rd party channels. The Shopify platform eventually evolved to the point where it became a viable option for us, and I suggested we transition. We moved our entire catalog of 1,200 products to Shopify. I developed a custom front-end theme and migrated our many landing pages. Despite Magento's abilities and features, Shopify became an excellent fit for the business due to how other employees of varying tech ability could benefit from a simple, clear backend UI. </p>

    <p> An essential part of our brand was the experience of shopping. Small details, like packaging, were very important when communicating our branding message. Our luxurious gift wrap and branded tissue paper were provided with every purchase. The earring cards were designed in Photoshop and printed on heavy cardstock. </p>
