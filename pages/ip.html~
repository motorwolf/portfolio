<h2>InPink Fashion Jewelry</h2>
    <p class="about">InPink was a fashion jewelry brand ecommerce site launched on the Magento platform. I developed several themes for the content, blog entries, product pages, landing pages optimized for conversion, and forms that delivered coupon codes integrated with mailchimp API for sign-ups.</p>

    <figcaption>I coded this sign-up form to mirror a print promotion that was included in several event gift bags. The form was coded by me, and the print design was created by me in Photoshop.</figcaption>

        <h3>Email and Landing Page Featurettes</h3>
        <p>Our email campaigns and promotions were the most important element of the site,offering unique styled content for the user. When buying fashion jewelry, the options are overwhelming. Our email campaigns featured curated content to take the guesswork out of accessorizing.</p>

    <h3>Site Evolution</h3>
    <p>As the site grew, our third-party platforms became more The Shopify platform eventually evolved to the point where it became a viable option for us, and I suggested we transition. We moved our entire catalog of 1,200 products to Shopify. I developed a custom front-end theme and migrated our many landing pages.</p>
    <h3>Package Design</h3>
    <p> An essential part of our brand was the experience of shopping. Small details, like packaging, were very important when communicating our branding message. Our luxurious gift wrap and branded tissue paper were provided with every purchase. These earring cards were designed in Photoshop and printed on heavy cardstock.
